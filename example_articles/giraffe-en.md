# The Giraffe - The gentle giant

With its long neck and distinctive spots, the giraffe is one of Africa's best-known animals. It is the largest land animal in the world.

## Unique anatomy

The giraffe's long neck is a masterpiece of evolution:
- Consists of only 7 cervical vertebrae (like humans!)
- Each vertebra is extremely elongated
- Allows it to reach leaves over 5 meters high
- Weighs about 250 kg

## Cardiovascular system

To pump blood to the head, the giraffe has an extraordinary cardiovascular system:
- Heart weighs up to 11 kg
- Blood pressure is twice as high as in humans
- Special venous valves prevent blood pooling when bending down
- Thick-walled blood vessels in the legs

## Diet

Giraffes are herbivores and feed mainly on:
- Acacia leaves (favorite)
- Buds
- Fruits
- Up to 30 kg of food per day

Their long, strong tongue (up to 50 cm) helps them pluck leaves between the thorns.

## Social behavior

Giraffes live in loose groups:
- No fixed herd structure
- Mothers form nursery groups for calves
- Males fight with their necks ("necking")
- Communication via infrasound

## Locomotion

Despite their size, giraffes are surprisingly fast:
- Move in a pace gait (both legs on one side at the same time)
- Can reach up to 60 km/h
- Jumping is not possible
- Drink with legs splayed

## Threats

Giraffes are increasingly threatened:
- Habitat loss
- Poaching
- Civil wars in their home countries
- Population down 40% in 30 years
