# The Giant Panda - China's National Treasure

The giant panda is one of the rarest and most beloved animals in the world. With its black-and-white fur and gentle demeanor, it wins hearts worldwide.

## Habitat

Pandas live exclusively in the mountain forests of central China:
- Elevations between 1,200 and 3,400 meters
- Dense bamboo forests
- Cool, moist climate
- Very limited range

## The bamboo diet

Although pandas belong to the carnivore family, they eat 99% bamboo:
- Eat up to 38 kg of bamboo per day
- Spend 12-16 hours a day eating
- Specialized "pseudo-thumb" for grasping
- Only 17% of the food is digested

This inefficient diet explains their leisurely lifestyle.

## Body structure

Pandas have unique adaptations:
- **Strong jaws**: to bite through tough bamboo stalks
- **Strong molars**: to grind the fibers
- **Dense fur**: protection from cold and wet
- **Rounded body**: energy reserves for times of scarce food

## Reproduction

Panda reproduction is a major challenge:
- Females are fertile only 2-3 days a year
- Solitary life
- Long gestation of 95-160 days
- Newborns weigh only 100-200 grams
- Usually only one cub is raised

## Threats and protection

Pandas were once heavily threatened with extinction, but intensive conservation measures are showing success:
- **Earlier**: fewer than 1,000 animals in the 1980s
- **Today**: about 1,864 animals in the wild
- Status improved from "endangered" to "vulnerable"
- Over 60 reserves in China
- Successful breeding programs worldwide

## Symbol for conservation

The panda is the emblem of the WWF and symbolizes worldwide conservation efforts. China practices "panda diplomacy" and lends pandas to zoos around the world.
